# Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin

Breast cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection is critical for successful treatment and higher survival rates.

Using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, this study uses machine learning algorithms to determine whether breast cancers are malignant or benign. Data preparation, feature selection, and several classification models were used, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, k-NN, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

The best-performing model was fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning. Model explainability approaches like SHAP and LIME were utilized to interpret the predictions. The final model had an accuracy of 97.37%, highlighting the promise of machine learning in medical diagnosis.
